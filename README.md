# TicTacToe-Game-In-C-
I follow Following classes to design TicTacToe Game
Board:
A 3x3 board to store, 9 characters. Besides constructor, getter, setter, init and show member functions
required.
Player:
The player has a name, a symbol (Any character, preferably some capital alphabet). Besides
constructor, getter, setter, takeTurn member function required (for the time being take cell number as
input in the function, take only valid input, otherwise take input again and again in the loop)
Game:
The game has board, player 1, player 2. Besides constructor, getter, setter, playGame member function
required. The playGame is the main function to interact with other objects to run the game, initialize
the game. You should add private functions to check winning by any plater.
This is a sample run of the game, you may do minor changes (if you think better). If you have any other
query, you may ask in the google class room but be concise and relevant.
